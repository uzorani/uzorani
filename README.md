- 👋 Hi! I’m Udi Zorani.
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and analytics, especially visual data :-)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analytics, some R, some Python, and using SVD's in visual-data applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can learn programming from.
- 📫 How to reach me? My number is +1.310.734.9859.
      And please, open with, "Found you on GitHub," so I don't mistakenly block your number.
